/**
Theme Name: OverCome

Adding support for languages written in a Right To Left (RTL) direction is easy,
it's just a matter of overwriting all the horizontal positioning attributes
of your CSS stylesheet in a separate stylesheet file named rtl.css.

==== IMPORTANT NOTE ====
OverCome using SASS to build style. All RTL style is build-in SASS
